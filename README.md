# Redes_UNAM
A project that plots the transportation network of UNAM University, plots the network using Networkx and find the shortest path between nodes using Dijkstra algorithm. The aim of the project is to give the user the best combination walking/ bus riding in order to get the fastest route to a campus destination. The project takes into account factors such as : weather conditions, time, and the safety of the user (takes into account the hour and the destination as to minimize the risk of a possible negative outcome).
